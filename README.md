# Subspace4DMRI

In MATLAB, change your current directory to your local path of the Subspace4DMRI repository. Run the demoSubspaceConstrained4DMRI.m script. This will load a test slice of k-space data and perform the reference and subspace-constrained 4D-MRI reconstructions described in the Radiotherapy and Oncology article.
